                <p class="paragraph-text">I have been building my career for about 10 years and my motivation has not changed: I am working to be part of the future. To reach this goal, I was teaching young adults to help them pursuing their dreams then I became a business operations specialist to promote success and financial growth. However, I have realised that my key to the future is technology.</p>
                <h3 class="heading-tertiary">What I have done so far</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text">At the beginning of my career, I spent four years in South Korea where I was teaching Hungarian at a university. After I returned to my home country, I became part of a business operations team where I gained experience on accounts receivable processes and supported customers from different parts of Europe.  Nowadays, I am heading towards something brand new as I started to advance my knowledge on technology, and I will be an IT consultant in an outstanding Nordic company from September 2021.</p>

In both roles, I was managing our business partners’ financial portfolios. My tasks included handling customer receivable issues, disputes, and claims. Additionally, I took part in cash application as well. As a collector I was supporting customers from Ireland, the United Kingdom and Finland. Later, I took over the Benelux market and worked together with customers from the Netherlands and Belgium. I became part of the business operations team when our processes were transferred to the Hungarian COE thus I could actively form our processes.</p>

                <p class="popup__text">I have been doing research since 2014. In 2019, I got the chance to spend almost two years at the University of Jyväskylä as a grant researcher. I have been in contact with the university since 2012, when I had the opportunity to work at the former TAIKU for a semester as a teacher trainee. Since then, I have been also taking part in editing a periodics, Spectrum Hungarologicum, which is published by the University of Jyväskylä and the University of Pécs. As a researcher, I focus on literary trauma studies in the context of contemporary Hungarian literature. I analyse narratives that deal with individual and collective memory of the Communist era and tackle mental trauma caused by political oppression and systematic victimization. Among other fields, my topic is in close connection with creative writing as well due to the potential therapeutic use of trauma narratives. </p>

                <p class="popup__text">I worked as an Assistant Professor between 2014 and 2017 at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea. I was a member of the Department of Hungarian Studies and my main duty was teaching Hungarian as a second language. In our Bachelor program, our students had the chance to gain advance knowledge on the language and the culture as well. I addition to that, I was hired to initiate a Finnish language and culture program within our department. I was teaching the basics of Finnish language, and I am very proud of the fact that some of my students have been chosen to participate in Summer courses in Finland. I also built valuable ties between the department and the Finnish Embassy in Seoul and we also had the opportunity to have a visiting professor from Turku for a short term.</p>
